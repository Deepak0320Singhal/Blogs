# Blogs

A small collection of Markdown blog posts and notes.

## Structure

- `Articles/` — Markdown files for posts

## Adding a post

- Create a new Markdown file in `Articles/`.
- Include a short header with at least `title` and `date` (YAML or plain text).

Simple example:

```yaml
---
title: "My Post"
date: 2026-01-09
---
```

## Contributing

Open a pull request to add or update posts.

## License

Add a `LICENSE` file if you want to specify terms.
